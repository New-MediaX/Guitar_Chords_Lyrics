Em               D
All the nights that I've missed you,

Em             C
All the nights without end,

G               D
All the times that I've called you

C        Em
When you needed a friend.


Em              D
Now your eyes shine with beauty,

Em          C
That I missed long ago,

G          D
Yes, the truth is I love you,

C       Em
I can't say any more.


C               D               Em   C     Em    C
Cos' I need you, yes I want you, yes I love you.


Em           D
As I look from my window

Em                C
To the streets where you stand

G              D
I am gazing through dark glass

C            Em
We can't walk hand in hand.

Em             D
Though your friends try to tell me

Em             C
Though your friends you defend,

G            D     
They keep my heart from your heart,

C          Em
We must meet in the end.
